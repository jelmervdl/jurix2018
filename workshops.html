<h2 id="aicol">AICOL - Artificial Intelligence and the Complexity of Legal Systems</h2>
<p>Duration: full day, December 12th</p>

<p>
The AICOL workshops welcome research in AI, political and legal theory, jurisprudence,
philosophy of technology and the law, social intelligence, NorMAS, to address the ways in
which the current information revolution affects basic pillars of today’s legal and political
systems, in such fields as e-democracy, e-government, e-justice, transnational governance,
Data Protection, and Security.

<h2 id="terecom">TeReCom - Technologies for Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>Duration: full day, December 12th</p>
<p>
The LYNX project is based on a very simple idea: the critical mass of legal open data on the web has been reached and if duly collected, analysed and interlinked as a Legal Knowledge Graph, it will be ready to enable a new breed of multilingual services for compliance. Thus the areas of interest in this workshop are three: (a) theoretical foundations and the legal regulatory framwork towards compliance in Europe; (b) the semantic web technologies which support the legal knowledge graph and (c) language technologies used to bridge the idiomatic barrier that hampers the commerce of products and services in Europe –for the latter see the also akin Workshop on Language Resources and Technologies for the Legal Knowledge Graph which took place in Japan in May 2018 within the LREC2018 conference.

<h2 id="xaila">XAILA - EXplainable AI in Law</h2>
<p>Duration: full day, December 12th</p>
<p>
Humanized AI emphasizes transparency and explainability in AI systems. These perspectives have an important ethical dimension, that is most often analyzed by philosophers. However, in order for it to be fruitful for AI engineers, it has to be properly focused. The intersection of Law and AI that makes it possible, as it provides a conceptual framework for ethical concepts and values in AI systems. A significant part of AI and Law research during the last two decades was devoted to operationalization of legal thinking with values. These results may now be reconsidered in a broader context, concerning the development of HAI systems and their social impact. It is a timely issue for the AI and Law community.

<h2 id="ledah">LeDAH - Legal Data Analytics Hackathon</h2>
<p>Duration: full day, December 12th</p>
<p>
Legal Data Analytics Hackathon aims to create applications/projects using data analytics methods applied to legal document and data. Cognitive biases should be avoided and for respecting the transparency principle we encourage to provide a self-explanation dataset, documentation, replication demo instructions, validation test set. Visualization of the results are very welcome in order to describe the results and to encourage legal practitioners, companies and citizens to use those emerging techniques. 
</p><p>
The winners will be presented during the JURIX 2018 conference (5 minutes pitch) and all the participants can have an exposition space in the conference.

<h2 id="manylaws">ManyLaws Project</h2>
<p>Duration: half-day, morning December 12th</p>
<p>
Legal information is an asset for decision making not only by EU institutions but also by member states, local administrations, businesses and citizens. Accurate, target-orientated, and timely information could enhance the digitisation of decision-making processes. Data such as legislation acts, bills, case laws, resolutions and decisions, published in each Member States’ language, as well as administration and citizen-generated content is increasingly embedded in large amounts of textual data available on the Internet. The vision of the ManyLaws project is thus to produce semantically annotated Big Legal Open Data, easily searchable and exploitable based on text mining tools and algorithms offered through proper visualization techniques. 
</p><p>
This workshop will provide a forum for scholars and practitioners from different backgrounds to discuss the factors that can contribute to the effective delivery of the new services proposed by Many Laws; thereby engaging participants in an interactive exploration of the legal and ethical implications associated with the application of advanced computing technologies to the acquisition, storage, and processing of legal information.
</p><p>
The workshop will be divided into two sessions, each comprising of three interrelated activities: 1) Introductory short presentations by the organisers 2) Group breakout sessions focusing on key issues, and 3) Interactive discussions to generate conclusions. Ideas and insights generated through discussions during this workshop will be recorded by the organisers and shared with workshop participants and the general public at a future date.

<h2 id="lda2018">LDA2018 - LEGAL DATA ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>Duration: half-day, afternoon December 12th</p>
<p>
The Workshop on Legal Data Analysis intends to focus on representation, analysis and reasoning with legal data. Workshop organisers are: Michal Araszkiewicz, Erich Schweighofer and Bernhard Waltl. The workshop at JURIX2018 would be already the 4th.

<h2 id="legaldesign">Legal Design as Academic Discipline: Foundations, Methodology, Applications</h2>
<p>Duration: half-day, morning December 12th</p>
<p>
Legal Design is an interdisciplinary approach to apply human-centered design to prevent or solve legal problems. It can help to create functional, inclusive and transparent legal documents, services, and systems. Whereas Legal Design is enjoying notable success in the business world, it has not yet been established as an academic discipline. This workshop welcomes theoretical contributions (e.g. what is the added value of Legal Design to the academic field? How can Legal Design help to develop and validate new legal theories?), but also description of practical applications (projects, practices and examples, especially if grounded in legal informatics).

<h2 id="dc">Doctoral Consortium</h2>
<p>Duration: half-day, afternoon December 12th</p>
<p>
The Jurix 2018 Doctoral Consortium aims at promoting the exchange of ideas from PhD researchers in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Law, and at providing them an opportunity to interact and receive feedback from leading scholars and experts in the field.
