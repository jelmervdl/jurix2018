					<h3>Long, Short, and Demo Paper submission</h3>

					<p>The deadline for paper submission is Sunday, September 16, 2018.</p>

					<p>The conference proceedings will be published by IOS Press in their series Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications (FAIA). Papers are to be submitted through the Easychair Conference Management System in PDF format:</p>

					<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jurix2018">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jurix2018</a></p>

					<p>All submissions should be formatted using <a href="http://www.iospress.nl/service/authors/latex-and-word-tools-for-book-authors/">the styles and guidelines in the IOS Press Instructions for Authors</a>.</p>

					<p>There are three categories of papers. Please indicate the category of your paper when you submit the paper to Easychair.</p>

					<h5>Long papers</h5>

					<p>These are reports of well-developed and original research. An accepted long paper scores well in terms of relevance, originality, technical quality, significance, literature review, presentation, reviewer’s confidence, and overall evaluation. These should not exceed 10 pages. A paper which is not accepted as a long paper may be recommended by reviewers as a short paper.</p>

					<h5>Short papers</h5>

					<p>Authors can submit short descriptions of preliminary results or an innovative idea. These papers	should not exceed 4 pages.</p>

					<h5>Demo papers</h5>

					<p>Authors can submit short descriptions of a system. These papers should not exceed 4 pages. Authors of demo papers should be willing to share (a screencast of) the demo privately with the reviewers, if so requested.</p>

					<h3>Double Submission</h3>

					<p>We welcome and encourage the submission of high quality, original papers, which are not simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere except to JURISIN 2018. Papers being submitted both to JURIX 2018 and JURISIN 2018 must note this on the title page, and a paper to be presented at JURIX 2018 must be withdrawn from JURISIN 2018 and vice versa according to the choice by the authors. Failure to follow this policy will result in the paper not being included in the proceedings of	JURIX 2018.</p>
