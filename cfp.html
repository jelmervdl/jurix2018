					<h2>3rd Call for papers</h2>
					
<p>
This year, the 29th Benelux Conference on Artificial Intelligence (JURIX 2018) is organized by the University of Groningen, Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Engineering, under the auspices of the Benelux Association for Artificial Intelligence (BNVKI) and the Dutch Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems (SIKS). JURIX 2018 will be held in Het Kasteel, Groningen, The Netherlands, on Wednesday 8 and Thursday 9 November, 2017. JURIX 2018 will include invited speakers, research presentations, posters and demonstrations. Also, a number of special sessions will be organized, including a ‘research meets business’ session.
</p>

<p>
Researchers are invited to submit unpublished original research on all aspects of Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, high-quality research results already published at international AI conferences or in AI journals are also welcome. Four types of submissions are invited:
</p>

<h3>Type A: REGULAR PAPERS</h3>

<p>
Papers presenting original work that advances Artificial Intelligence. In addition to papers on original work, position and review papers are also welcomed. These contributions should address a well-developed body of research, an important new area, or a promising new topic, and provide a big picture view. Type A-papers can be long or short. Long papers should be 10-15 pages, short papers 6-10 pages. Contributions will be reviewed on overall quality and relevance. Type A-Papers can be accepted for either oral or poster presentation.
</p>

<h3>Type B: COMPRESSED CONTRIBUTIONS</h3>

<p>
Abstracts of already published work. Papers that have been accepted after June 1, 2016 for AI-related refereed conferences or journals can be resubmitted and will be accepted as compressed contributions. Authors are invited to submit the officially published version (without page restriction) together with a 2-page abstract. Type B-Papers will be accepted for either oral or poster presentation. Authors may submit at most one type B-paper of which they are the corresponding author.
</p>

<h3>Type C: DEMONSTRATIONS</h3>

<p>
Demonstration abstracts. Proposals for demonstration should be submitted as a 2-page abstract together with a short video illustrating the working of the system (not exceeding 15 minutes). Demonstrations will be evaluated based on their originality and innovative character, the technology deployed, the purpose of the systems in interaction with users and/or other systems, and their economic and/or societal potential. Any system requirements should also be mentioned.
</p>

<h3>Type D: THESIS ABSTRACTS</h3>

<p>
Abstracts of graduation reports. Bachelor and Master students are invited to submit a 2-page abstract of their completed AI-related thesis. Supervisors should be listed. The thesis should be accepted after June 1, 2016. Type D-papers will be judged on relevance for the conference and originality. Type D-Papers can be accepted for either oral or poster presentation.
</p>

<p>
Accepted contributions within all four categories will be included in the online conference proceedings. All contributions should be written in English, using the Springer CCIS/LNCS format (see <a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>) and submitted electronically via EasyChair (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bnaic2017">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bnaic2017</a>). Submission implies willingness of at least one author to register for JURIX 2018 and present the paper. For each paper, a separate author registration is required. We are aiming to continue the collaboration with Springer (that started in 2016) to produce postproceedings in their CCIS series (<a href="http://www.springer.com/series/7899">http://www.springer.com/series/7899</a>).
